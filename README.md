PowerBi - Worldwide Covid-19 Data Analysis

Happy Monday everyone, I hope you all had a great weekend!
 
Todayâ€™s post introduces my first #portfolioproject, this time using #powerbi to explore worldwide Covid-19 data. 

The data was retrieved from OurWorldInData covers the period from January 2020 to Mar 2023. Nevertheless, the team continues to update the data daily. I want to give a big thank you to team at Our World In Data for making this valuable resource available to the public! 

Here are some questions I wanted to answer: 
1.	What is the top 3 countries with the highest Covid-19 cases and death?
2.	What is the total vaccination rate in Asia vs Europe?
3.	How does a country's GDP relate to its vaccination rate?
4.	How does vaccination affect death rate of a country?


Answers based on data: 
1.	Top 3 countries with highest cases of Covid-19 are United States, China and India; top 3 countries with highest deaths are USA, Brazil & India.
2.	Vaccination Rate in Asia (72.80%) vs Europe (67.59%).
3.	High income countries tend to have higher vaccination rates compared to low- and middle-income countries. 
4.	High vaccination rate in a country tend to lower the death rate caused by Covid-19 


I had a great time creating this project and it was interesting to see how different factors can impact a country's COVID-19 situation.
